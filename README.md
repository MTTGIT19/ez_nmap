# ez_nmap
Even easier nmap

A fun Infosec project I created for a 'Security Scripting with Python' Masters class.  

#### [Features]  
Ez_nmap uses vulnerability and enumeration tools that help a beginner user learn more about their computer. Everything is wrapped up into a colorful easy-to-read, and intuitive terminal menu. I orginally designed it to combine multiple tools into one menu system so you could quicky cycle through your favorite scans. It currently feaures both NMAP and NIKTO, although it could easily be expanded to include more.
